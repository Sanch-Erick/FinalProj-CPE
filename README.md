# FinalProj-CPE
The complete Arduino code for a swamp cooler project

Created/modified by 
Erick Sanchez

The files deleted mentioned by github were all of the previous labs, which cluttered this quite a bit
The order of programming began at Overview.pdf which led to prototype. The purpose of these two were to 
make sure I had a proper Idea of what a swamp cooler was and if the components in the kit even worked in the 
first place.

Prefinal is where most of the logic and structure, here I translated it directly into the final code where the video 
and photos took place in. The commits to this git aren't quite useful but the names quickly became the identity of each
one. for context while I worked on this my computer hasn't been shut down for two days and ten hours, so each push on the
git was towards the end of that file.

The overview is missing the link below, all credit to those articles and the folks who made the lab codes I depended on!
